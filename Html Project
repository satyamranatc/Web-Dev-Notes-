    <h3>What Is Robotics?</h3>
    <h3>
      Robotics is a field of study that focuses on the study of the interactions
      between human and robots.
    </h3>
    <details>
      In simple terms, robotics combines science, engineering, and technology to
      design, construct, operate, and use machines programmed to replicate,
      substitute, or assist humans in completing tasks of varying complexity.
      These machines are known as robots. Robots have a long history, dating
      back to ancient Greece; notably, the first digital-operated and
      programmable robot debuted in the mid-twentieth century. Robotics quickly
      took over key industries like automotive manufacturing, with early spot
      welding robot prototypes used in General Motors facilities in 1961.
      Throughout the years, robotics has developed increasingly sophisticated
      machines to benefit a wide range of industries. Today, robots are in use
      everywhere around the globe, from college clubs to Fortune 100s. Companies
      and individuals alike are harnessing the power of robotics more than ever
      before, with the value of the Global Robotics Market rising to over 27
      billion USD in 2020. What are some of the common types of robots? The most
      common types of robots include: Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs) Using
      sophisticated sensors, artificial intelligence, and machine learning,
      autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) can support many tasks, including
      delivering items, carrying out safety and security checks, inventory
      automation, rescue missions, crop harvesting, and even space exploration.
      Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs) As a form of autonomous mobile robots,
      automated guided vehicles (AGVs) are movable robots capable of navigating
      mapped routes via wires on a floor, radio waves, cameras, magnets, or
      lasers. These robots have several applications, including transporting
      heavy materials in factories and warehouses. Articulated Robots One of the
      main features of an articulated robot is rotary joints that can range from
      simple two-jointed structures to complex systems of multiple interacting
      joints and materials. The articulated robot is a typical type of
      industrial robot and often resembles a human arm. Humanoids A humanoid
      robot resembles a generic human body form. The specialized design is
      typically used for mimicking human motions and interactions. A common use
      case of humanoid robots is automating tasks to increase efficiency and
      cost-savings.
